# Welcome to my site

Congratualtions on finding your way to my website. I hope that you will find it's content interesting, revealing and most importantly you learn something. The site is a compilation of not only my work in the field of complexity/complex adaptive systems (CASs) and agent-based modelling (ABM) but also the works that served as inspiration for me along the way. 

The website is updated regualarly with new articles that I find and post on either my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oldhamma) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maoldham74) sites.

## What are complex adaptive systems, and why are they important?
A complex adaptive system (CAS) can be found anywhere from an ecological to an economic system. The key characteristics of these systems are that the agents within the system interact in a non-linear fashion with other agents, and their environment resulting in collective behavior. This is turn makesthe system non-predictable beyond a certain temporal window.

 


## Why study Computational Social Science?
Computational social science (CSS) is an emerging field at the intersection of social science, math, and computer science that utilizes numerical models to further our understanding of societies, markets, and human behavior. In contrast to traditional approaches to social science (e.g., inferential statistics, axiomatic modeling, or interviews), the numerical nature of the models present both unique opportunities and methodological challenges that will be discussed throughout the semester. For example, how do we introduce adaptive behavior into our models of human conflict and cooperation? Why are things as they are? How do we evaluate policies when decision makers are boundedly rational? The course addresses these questions drawing on recent advances in computational modeling and data science.

## What are Agent-based models, and why use them?
To explore how macro-patterns such as residential segregation, cultural norms, and social networks emerge from micro-behavior, we will discuss the bottom-up framework of agent-based modeling. A modelling technique, where the model is made up of automisouse decision making entities. These are agents and take the form of anything from a particle to government. Commonly a person. The collection of the agents then becomes the system. When the agents interact with other agents and their environment an emergent property should occur. The principle is to make the rules as simple of possible yet generate the emergent behavior at the the sysytem or macro level.

This sort of analyis is not feasible with traditonal techniques.
