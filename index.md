# Background
## What are complex adaptive systems, and why are they important?
A CAS can be found anywhere from an ecological to an economic system. The key characteristics of these systems are that the agents, within the system ,interact in a non-linear fashion with other agents, and their environment. This results in complex collective behavior. That is a small number of rules applied locally are responsible for generating complex global phenomena. This is turn makes the system non-predictable beyond a certain temporal window. A key attribute of a CAS are emergent outcomes, which is when larger entities, patterns, and regularities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities that themselves do not exhibit such properties.

Here is a 10 minutes video that does a great job of explaining it.

It is the presence of these unexpected emergent outcomes that underlies the need to gain a greater understanding of CAS. Classic examples of these emergent behavior is how communities becomes highly segregated despite the population not being predisposed to segregation (see Schelling  (1971), how birds form large flocks, traffic jams form and propagate, or how asset bubbles are created.

In terms of complexity science, it is should be noted that it is not a theory per se but rather a movement in the sciences that studies how the interacting elements in a system create overall patterns, and how these overall patterns in turn cause the interacting elements to change or adapt.

## Why study Computational Social Science?
Computational social science (CSS) is an exciting, and emerging discipline that is at the intersection of social science, math, and computer science. The intention of CSS is to utilize numerical models and data analytics to further our understanding of societies, markets, and human behavior. In contrast to traditional approaches to social science (e.g., inferential statistics, axiomatic modeling, or interviews), the computational approach present both unique opportunities and methodological challenges. For example, how should adaptive behavior be introduced? How do we evaluate policies and outcomes when decision makers are boundedly rational? How do avoid spurious inferences resulting from an over analysis of data?

Within the CSS framework various computational and modelling tools have, and continue to be developed to understand and/or make predictions regarding social science issues. Examples of the techniques employed are: agent-based modelling, social network analysis, machine learning, content analysis and geographic information systems. It is by combining formalized theories and empirical research that has allowed researchers to study and further develop their understanding of social complexity, via methods not available elsewhere.

I have provided the following video from the [2nd Annual International Conference on Computational Social Science](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news-events/conference/ic2s2/2016.aspx), hosted by the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, to help explain what CSS is and is not. In the video, several speakers discuss the definition of CSS, with an important point being made by the first presenter, Duncan Watts, when he mentions that initially CSS revolved around simulations but it is now growing into a much larger and diverse field.

## What are agent-based models, and why use them?
Herbert Simon, in his book The Sciences of the Artificial makes the point that complex adaptive systems are predisposed to simulation. The rationale being that one does not need to identify the properties of the all parts of a system in their entirety, if the goal is to understand how the parts organize themselves to create certain macro outcomes. In turn, these outcomes are likely to arise independently of all but a few properties of the individual components. The implication being that these macro outcomes need to be assessed from a bottom-up perspective. In trying to simulate these emergent processes researchers are required to make certain abstractions, with the intentive being to create a model of target that is simpler to study than the target itself.

One method of simulation that can achieve the objectives of bottom-up simulation is ABM. Agent-based model (ABMs) allow researchers to assess, in a silicon laboratory, the micro-level interactions that give rise to verifiable macro outcomes. This is achieved through heterogeneous agents adapting and making decisions based on their environment, including considering spatial, temporal factors and from interactions with other agents. Additionally, the agents in these models are not constrained to equilibrium conditions. Therefore, ABMs allows one to understand and predict from the bottom up. 

The key benefits of ABMs over other simulation techniques, as articulated by Axtell (2000), are that it may be the only way to uncover the solution structure, test the dynamics of the system, and test the sensitivity of the modelâ€™s output against its parameters and assumptions. In implementing an agent-based model the principle is to make the rules as simple of possible yet generate the emergent behavior at the system or macro level.
