# Welcome to my site

Congratualtions on finding your way to my website. I hope that you will find it's content interesting, revealing and most importantly you learn something. The site is a compilation of not only my work in the field of complexity/complex adaptive systems (CASs) and agent-based modelling (ABM) but also the works that served as inspiration for me along the way. 

The website is updated regularly with new articles that I find and post on either my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oldhamma) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maoldham74) sites.

# Background
## What are complex adaptive systems, and why are they important?
A CAS can be found anywhere from an ecological to an economic system. The key characteristics of these systems are that the agents within the system interact in a non-linear fashion with other agents, and their environment resulting in collective behavior. That is a small number of rules applied locally are responsible for generating complex global phenomena. This is turn makes the system non-predictable beyond a certain temporal window. A key attribute of a CAS emergent outcomes, which is where stable macro patterns arise from local interaction of the agent. Here is a 10 minutes video that does a far better job of explaining it.

In terms of complexity, it is not a theory but rather a movement in the sciences that studies how the interacting elements in a system create overall patterns, and how these overall patterns in turn cause the interacting elements to change or adapt.

## Why study Computational Social Science?
Computational social science (CSS) is an emerging field at the intersection of social science, math, and computer science that utilizes numerical models to further our understanding of societies, markets, and human behavior. In contrast to traditional approaches to social science (e.g., inferential statistics, axiomatic modeling, or interviews), the numerical nature of the models present both unique opportunities and methodological challenges. For example, how do we introduce adaptive behavior into our models of human conflict and cooperation? Why are things as they are? How do we evaluate policies when decision makers are boundedly rational? 

CSS is used as a language to formalize theory and empirical research to express, study and develop our understanding of social complexity not available elsewhere.	Framework that encompasses various computational and modelling tools that allow to either improve understand/make predictions about an issue.

I provided a video from the [2nd Annual International Conference on Computational Social Science](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news-events/conference/ic2s2/2016.aspx), hosted by by the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. In the video several speakers discuss the defintion of CSS, with an important point made by the first presenter, Duncan Watts, when he mentions that initially CSS revolved around simulations but it is now growing into a much larger and diverse field.

## What are agent-based models, and why use them?
From Herbert Simon - Adaptive systems are predisposed to simulation. Why? Do not need to identify all the inner parts if just interested in how these parts organize independently of all but a few properties of the individual components.

For a complex system	Behavior at one level may lead to a new entity emerging which has new behavior and therefore needs a new class of model. CREATE A MODEL OF TARGET THAT IS SIMPLER TO STUDY THAN THE TARGET ITSELF 

The model at the macro level does not have a set of equilibrium conditions and/or problems to solve for (noting that agents can have these)
Method that allows analyst to create, analyze and experiment with artificial worlds populated by agents that interact in non-trivial ways and that constitutes their own environment <- need to understand and predict from the bottom up

To explore how macro-patterns such as residential segregation, cultural norms, and social networks emerge from micro-behavior, we will discuss the bottom-up framework of agent-based modeling. A modelling technique, where the model is made up of automisouse decision making entities. These are agents and take the form of anything from a particle to government. Commonly a person. The collection of the agents then becomes the system. When the agents interact with other agents and their environment an emergent property should occur. The principle is to make the rules as simple of possible yet generate the emergent behavior at the the sysytem or macro level.

This sort of analyis is not feasible with traditonal techniques.
