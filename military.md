Agent-based models (ABMs) have been sucessfully across multiple fields. The military has been one such field. While some of the applications are kept underwarps, this page provides a brief run down on the know appications of ABMs to military appications. I also provide a brief run down on my contribution to the field. 

A lot of the information on this page came from Prof. Ken Comer's GMU CSS739 Agent-based Models: Military Applications course that was taught in the Fall of 2016

## Historical Military Application


Battle of Trafalgar

Complex model including wind, two kinds of combat, four classes of ships, varying crew efficiency, etc. ▫Both area winds and local winds (affected by sails) •Ships can “escape” of surrender based on their levels of casualties ▫With enough damage, ships can be sunk •Sails can be degraded, limiting mobility 

Matched all historical outcomes 

Battle of Isandlwana:
Strategic error: British believed their main risk was that the enemy would disperse ▫Sent out half their force on armed recce  ▫Badly underestimating enemy, British failed to entrench ▫Believed (based on experience) in the shock value of large force armed with breech-loading rifles •Remaining force failed to circle the wagons and form a “laager”, remained in a line •Result: complete annihilation of the British force at Isandlwana, retreat of columns
