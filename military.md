Agent-based models (ABMs) have been sucessfully across multiple fields. The military has been one such field. While some of the applications are kept underwarps, this page provides a brief run down on the know appications of ABMs to military appications. I also provide a brief run down on my contribution to the field. A lot of the information on this page came from Prof. Ken Comer's GMU CSS739 Agent-based Models: Military Applications course that was taught in the Fall of 2016

Why are ABMs applicaable to military conflicts?

Comabt particularly land combat, possess the characteristics of complex adaptive systems: combat forces are composed of a large number of nonlinearly interacting parts and are organized in a dynamic command-and-control network; local action, which often appears disordered, self-organizes into long-range order; military conflicts, by their nature, proceed far from equilibrium; military forces adapt to a changing combat environment; and there is no master “voice” that dictates the actions of every soldier (i.e., battlefield action is decentralized). Nonetheless, most modern “state of the art” military simulations ignore the self-organizing properties of combat


## Real World Military Application

Can not run combat experiments in peacetime ▫Even in conflict, the concept of designed experimentation is absurd
The need for and use of simulation to understand future combat predates the computer:

  -  Germany invented and developed the concept of wargaming with Kriegspiel
  -  Naval War College wargaming in 1930s
  
Numerous links between combat simulation and ABMs in the 1990s  
   - ISAAC (Irreducible Semi-Autonomous Adaptive Combat) Model (1997) 
   - EINSTein (Enhanced ISAAC Neural Simulation Toolkit) Model (2000) 
   - Pythagoras agent-based combat model (c. 2002)
   
Ilachinski, Artificial War. .This book summarizes the results of a multiyear research effort aimed at exploring the applicability of complex adaptive systems theory to the study of warfare, and introduces a sophisticated multiagent-based simulation of combat called EINSTein. EINSTein, whose bottom-up, generative approach to modeling combat stands in stark contrast to the top-down or reductionist philosophy that still underlies most conventional military models, is designed to illustrate how many aspects of land combat may be understood as self-organized, emergent phenomena. Used worldwide by the military operations research community, EINSTein has pioneered the simulation of combat on a small to medium scale by using autonomous agents to model individual behaviors and personalities rather than hardware.

Died out but some use

## Historical Military Application


### Battle of Trafalgar

Complex model including wind, two kinds of combat, four classes of ships, varying crew efficiency, etc. ▫Both area winds and local winds (affected by sails) •Ships can “escape” of surrender based on their levels of casualties ▫With enough damage, ships can be sunk •Sails can be degraded, limiting mobility 

Matched all historical outcomes 

### Battle of Isandlwana

Strategic error: British believed their main risk was that the enemy would disperse ▫Sent out half their force on armed recce  ▫Badly underestimating enemy, British failed to entrench ▫Believed (based on experience) in the shock value of large force armed with breech-loading rifles •Remaining force failed to circle the wagons and form a “laager”, remained in a line •Result: complete annihilation of the British force at Isandlwana, retreat of columns

### Battle of Britian
