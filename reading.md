## Reading

Over the years I have managed to get through a number of very interesting books that have helped open my mind and sharpen my research focus. The books are likely to fall into one of two catergoies: one, a book that demonstrates an "out of the box" theme, or two a book that provides meaningful insight into an important or series of important events.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/moldham74/AussieABM/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
