## Reading

Over the years I have managed to get through a number of very interesting books that have helped open my mind and sharpen my research focus. The books are likely to fall into one of two categories: one, a book that demonstrates an "out of the box" theme, or two a book that provides meaningful insight into an important or series of important events. I have not restricted my reading to just finance and economics as I am believer in a interdisciplinary approach. A great example of this is the lesson that one learns from reading Micael Lewis's _Moneyball_.

While on Michael Lewis, I have not added any of his because books to my list for the simple reason that they are all complusory reading.

I am have broken my reading list into an economics and finanace, and an 'list'.
