# About Me

_"There is only one to avoid criticism: Do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing"_ - Aristotle 


I am currently a Computational Social Science (CSS) Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computational and Data Sciences](https://cos.gmu.edu/cds/academic-programs/) at George Mason University. My orignal intention was to only complete my masters is CSS but as things turned out I am doing my mastsers. Being awarded a prestigious George Mason University, four-year Presidential scholarship is certainly a great help, and has provided me extensive freedom to research and explore a variety of topics.

My research is now focused on applying CSS for purpose of gaining a greater understanding of how financial markets behave and to  explore the dynamics driving innovation. To achieve my research goals I have positioned myself at the intersection of agent-based modelling, network analysis, and big data. This has meant that I have had to get up to speed on all the latest computation techniques.

Thus far my research has produced two publications relating to influence of investor networks on the behavior of stock markets, and one on innovation. These papers can be found on my publications page, while my economics and finance pages provide a detailed summary on my work and the justfication for it. Beyond this I have implemented an ABM to explore the strategies used in the Battle of Britain, and have pioneered the use of ABMs for the use sports analytics.
