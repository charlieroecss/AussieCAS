# About Me

_"There is only one to avoid criticism: Do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing"_ - Aristotle 


I am currently a Computational Social Science (CSS) Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computational and Data Sciences](https://cos.gmu.edu/cds/academic-programs/) at George Mason University. My advisor, [Professor Axtell](http://www.css.gmu.edu/~axtell/Rob/Home.html) is a world leading expert in agent-based modelling (and most other things!). My original intention was to only complete my masters is CSS but as things turned out I am doing my Ph.D.. Being awarded a prestigious George Mason University Presidential scholarship is certainly a great help, and has provided me extensive freedom to research and explore a variety of topics as I progress through the Ph.D. program.

My research is focused on applying CSS for purpose of gaining a greater understanding of how financial markets behave and to explore the dynamics driving innovation. To achieve my research goals, I have positioned myself at the intersection of agent-based modelling, network analysis, and big data. This has meant that I have had to get up to speed on all the latest computation techniques.

Thus, far my research has produced two publications relating to influence of investor networks on the behavior of stock markets, and one on innovation. These papers can be found on my publications page, while my economics and finance pages provide a detailed summary on my work and the justification for it. Beyond this I have implemented an ABM to explore the strategies used in the Battle of Britain, and have pioneered the use of ABMs for the use sports analytics.

# Background
If you are not that interested in reading the details here, you can check-out [my resume](  ), or my [Linkedin profile](linkedin.com/in/oldhamma).

## Personal Background
I was born on the great island of Tasmania, which sits to the south of mainland Australia. My people think not a lot happens in Tasmania but it was a great place to grow up. I made the big move to the mainland following the completion of my initial tertiary studies, and lived in Melbourne. The family and I then made the big move to Fairfax, Virginia in 2014 where I started my current studies.

## Education
My academic career originally kicked off in Tasmania, where I attended the University of Tasmania and was awarded a Bachelors of Economics with honors in 1995. I then put myself through the [Chartered Financial Analyst program](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/Pages/index.aspx), earning my charter designation in 2012. However, my desire to continue my learning and to gain greater insights in CAS saw me enrol in the Masters of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies with a concentration in Computational Social Science at George Mason in 2014. I was subsequently awarded my degree in 2016.

## Work Experience
In bewteen my studies I have had exciting and varied professional career. After university I started work at Toyota Australia, and undertook numerous tasks including:

- Bulleted
- Develop internal management information system (MIS), including pioneering forecasting
- SAP R3 implementation team

I then moved onto Ford Performance Vehicles where I helped running the sales and production planning processes.

A career change then beckoned and I made the switch to Equity Trustees in 2006. Initially my work involved strategy planning, and implementations, including merger and acquisitions. I was then lucky enough to join the equities team, where I was a buy-side analyst for a number of years. It was during this period when searching for greater insights to help inform superior investment decisions that came across the complexity, and as the say the rest in history.
