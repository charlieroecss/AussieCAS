_"You can't score a goal if you don't take a shot"_  - Johan Cruyff

Sports analytics (SA) has experienced a meteoritic rise in recent years, with the trend forecast to continue. [Modor Intelligence] (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sports-analytics-market-growing-at-379-cagr-to-2021-2016-05-09-2203123) reports that the market was valued at USD 83.56 million in 2015, and is forecast to grow to USD 447.23 million by 2020. However, the growth was a long time in the making as the genesis of SA can be traced back over 50 years. The delayed adaption was partly due to the field being seen as frivolous and a hobby industry, and as told in Moneyball a reluctance of sporting organizations to include it in their decision-making.  However, this has now changed, with the only downside being that the innovative work is being carried out within the sports organizations with the work hidden from the public realm. However, this is changing given the massive amount of publicly available sporting data, and the field being taken seriously in the academic world.  

## Sports as a complex system

The consideration of sports being a complex adaptive system (CAS) is a newly established field of research. There are a host of papers provided here. One of the key ramification of the research, that comes from Gabel and Redner, is that the scoring activity (lead changes, lead magnitude and the persistence of the lead) in a game of numerous sports follows a random-walk, with the exception being when a quarter comes to a close. At this point the distribution of the scoring activity becomes consistent what would be predicted by a power-law.

Given the billionaires of dollars invested globally in sporting franchises globally it may be somewhat disconcerting for fans to learn the game is a random walk. However, all is not lost because the outcome does not imply that skill has no role, rather given relatively even skill levels at the highest level, this negates any systematic advantage leaving the random walk (stochastic process). Another explanation for the random walk process is that players are short-term focused (gee is this behavior seen in financial markets?), as they attempt to maximize their scoring while minimizing the immediate opportunities of their opponents. This means that there is little strategic play and players react to events as they occur. 

The random walk process also implies that teams cannot get “hot” -- i.e., record an extended streak of making their attempts. The following paper is a great run down on the “hot hand” debate. In summary though it is one of the great cognitive errors.
